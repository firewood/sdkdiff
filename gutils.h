/* --- status line window class ---------------------------------- */
/* The status line is a bar across the top or bottom of the window.
 * It can hold a number of fields which can be either static text
 * or buttons.  The so called "static" text can be changed at any time.
 * The fields can be left or right aligned (default is RIGHT).
 * If the text is marked as VAR then the screen real estate allocated
 * for it will be adjusted whenever the text changes.  VAR fields
 * can be given minimum or maximum sizes (but not both).
 *
 * STATIC text fields can be drawn as raised or lowered rectangles (using
 * shades of grey), or (default) without a border. BUTTON fields will
 * always be drawn as raised rectangles, and will lower when pressed.
 *
 * Button fields will send WM_COMMAND messages when clicked including the
 * field id and the WM_LBUTTONUP notification code. Note that that this
 * is not a full implementation of the button class, and no other messages
 * will be sent. In general, none of the fields of a status bar are
 * implemented as separate windows, so GetDlgItem() and similar calls will not
 * work. Buttons only respond to mouse down events, and there is no handling
 * of the focus or of keyboard events.
 *
 * To use:
 *    call StatusAlloc giving the number of items you are going to add to the
 *    status bar. This returns a handle to use in subsequent calls.
 *
 *    Then call StatusAddItem to define each item in turn.
 *    Buttons are placed in order of definition along the bar starting from
 *    the left (SF_LEFT) and from the right (SF_RIGHT) until the two
 *    sides meet.
 *
 *    Call StatusHeight to find the expected height of this status bar, and
 *    set its position within the parent window, then call StatusCreate to
 *    create the window.
 *
 * Having created the window, send SM_SETTEXT messages to set the new
 * text of a field (static or button), or SM_NEW with a handle (obtained from
 * StatusAlloc) to change the contents of the status line.
